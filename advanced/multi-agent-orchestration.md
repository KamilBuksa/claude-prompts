# 🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Scale your development with coordinated AI teams** - From solo coding to enterprise workflows.

## The Multi-Agent Philosophy

> *"PM agent który tworzy podagentów np FE i BE developers, QA, UX i każdy raportuje do niego a on na koniec to usera"*

**Key Principle:** Different workspaces (NOT branches) for safe agent collaboration.

## Workspace Separation Strategy

### ⚠️ Critical Rule: Different Workspaces, Not Branches
```bash
project/
├── main-workspace/           # PM Agent coordination
├── frontend-workspace/       # Frontend Agent isolated work  
├── backend-workspace/        # Backend Agent isolated work
├── qa-workspace/            # QA Agent testing work
└── ux-workspace/            # UX Agent design work
```

**Why Workspaces, Not Branches:**
- **Isolation**: Agents can't accidentally modify each other's work
- **Safety**: No merge conflicts between AI implementations  
- **Parallel**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Integration**: Clean handoffs through defined interfaces

## Agent Hierarchy & Roles

### 🎯 PM Agent (Orchestrator)
**Responsibilities:**
- Project planning and task breakdown
- Coordinating between specialized agents
- Integration and final delivery
- Quality assurance and consistency
- Stakeholder communication

**PM Agent Prompt Template:**
```
You are the PM Agent for [project]. Your role:

1. Break down features into tasks for specialized agents
2. Coordinate between FE, BE, QA, and UX agents
3. Ensure consistency across all implementations
4. Manage integration and delivery
5. Report progress to user

Current feature: [feature description]
Agents available: FE, BE, QA, UX
Project constraints: [timeline, tech stack, requirements]

Create task breakdown and coordination plan.
```

### 🎨 Frontend Agent (FE)
**Specialization:**
- React/Vue/Angular implementation

**QA Agent Setup:**
```
You are the QA Agent. Focus exclusively on:

Testing Framework: [Jest/Cypress/Playwright]
Coverage Targets: [Unit 80%, Integration 60%, E2E key flows]
Quality Gates: [Performance, accessibility, security]

Work in qa-workspace/ only.
Test all agent implementations.
Report quality metrics to PM Agent.
```

### 🎨 UX Agent  
**Specialization:**

- Design system compliance
- Accessibility implementation
- User flow optimization

**UX Agent Setup:**
```
You are the UX Agent. Focus exclusively on:

Design System: [Component library, tokens]
Accessibility: [WCAG 2.1 AA compliance]
User Research: [Personas, user journeys]
Metrics: [Usability, conversion, engagement]

Work in ux-workspace/ only.
Review all user-facing implementations.
Report UX metrics to PM Agent.
```

## Orchestration Patterns

### 1. Sequential Coordination
```mermaid
PM Agent → UX Agent (design) → FE Agent (implement) → BE Agent (API) → QA Agent (test) → PM Agent (integrate)
```

### 2. Parallel Development
```mermaid
                    PM Agent
                       ↓
        ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
        ↓              ↓              ↓
    FE Agent      BE Agent      UX Agent
        ↓              ↓              ↓
                 QA Agent ←─────────────┘
                    ↓
                PM Agent (integration)
```

## Agent Communication Protocols

### Status Reporting Template
```markdown
## Agent Status Report - [Agent Type] - [Date]

### Current Task
[Description of current work]

### Progress
- ✅ Completed: [list of completed items]
- 🔄 In Progress: [current work with ETA]  
- ⏳ Blocked: [blockers with details]

### Dependencies
- Waiting for: [what/who they're waiting for]
- Providing to: [what they're delivering to whom]

### Quality Metrics
- Tests: [status and coverage]
- Performance: [metrics if applicable]
- Standards: [compliance status]

### Next Steps
[What they plan to do next]

### Questions for PM Agent
[Any clarifications needed]
```

### Integration Handoff Protocol
```markdown
## Integration Package - [Agent] → PM Agent

### Deliverables
- [ ] Code implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing (coverage: X%)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Dependencies documented
- [ ] Known issues listed

### Integration Notes
- Files modified: [list]
- API contracts: [specifications]
- Database changes: [migrations]
- Configuration: [environment variables]

### Quality Verification
- [ ] Meets acceptance criteria
- [ ] Follows project standards
- [ ] Performance tested
- [ ] Security reviewed

### Handoff Instructions
1. [Step-by-step integration guide]
2. [Testing instructions]
3. [Rollback procedures]
```

## Advanced Orchestration Strategies

### Smart Task Distribution
```
PM Agent analyzes feature complexity and distributes:

Simple CRUD → BE Agent only
Complex UI → FE Agent + UX Agent collaboration  
Critical feature → All agents in sequence with extra QA
Performance issue → BE Agent + FE Agent parallel optimization
```

### Conflict Resolution
```
When agents disagree or create conflicts:

1. PM Agent mediates with full context
2. Technical decisions → Lead technical agent
3. UX decisions → UX Agent authority
4. Business decisions → PM Agent with user consultation
5. Integration issues → PM Agent coordinates resolution
```

### Quality Gates & Checkpoints
```
Automatic quality checks at each handoff:

FE Agent → PM Agent:
- [ ] Components match design system
- [ ] Tests coverage >80%
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility standards met

BE Agent → PM Agent:  
- [ ] API contracts match specification
- [ ] Security validations in place
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
```

## Real-World Implementation

### Project Setup Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup-multi-agent-workspace.sh

echo "Setting up multi-agent workspace for: $1"

mkdir -p "$1"/{main,frontend,backend,qa,ux}-workspace

# PM Agent workspace
cat > "$1/main-workspace/CLAUDE.md" << EOF
# PM Agent Configuration
Role: Project Manager and Orchestrator
Responsibilities: Task breakdown, coordination, integration
Agents: Frontend, Backend, QA, UX
Project: $1
EOF

# Frontend Agent workspace  
cat > "$1/frontend-workspace/CLAUDE.md" << EOF
# Frontend Agent Configuration
Role: Frontend Implementation Specialist
Focus: UI, state management, API integration
Reports to: PM Agent in main-workspace
EOF

# Continue for other agents...
```

### Agent Spawn Commands
```bash
# Aliases for spawning specialized agents
alias spawn-pm='cd main-workspace && claude --agent pm'
alias spawn-fe='cd frontend-workspace && claude --agent frontend'  
alias spawn-be='cd backend-workspace && claude --agent backend'
alias spawn-qa='cd qa-workspace && claude --agent qa'
alias spawn-ux='cd ux-workspace && claude --agent ux'
```

## Scaling Patterns

### Small Team (2-3 agents)
- PM Agent + FE Agent + BE Agent
- PM handles QA and UX oversight

### Medium Team (4-5 agents)  
- Full specialization: PM, FE, BE, QA, UX
- Clear boundaries and handoffs

### Large Team (6+ agents)
- Sub-teams with specialized PM agents
- Domain-specific agents (Auth, Payments, etc.)
- Integration specialists

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Gains
- **Development Speed**: 3-5x faster than single agent
- **Code Quality**: Higher due to specialization
- **Bug Detection**: Earlier through QA agent integration
- **Consistency**: Better through PM coordination

### Quality Improvements  
- **Test Coverage**: QA agent ensures comprehensive testing
- **UX Standards**: UX agent maintains consistency
- **Performance**: Specialized optimization by domain experts
- **Security**: BE agent focuses on security best practices

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

❌ **Agents working on same files**
✅ Solution: Strict workspace separation

❌ **Communication overhead**  
✅ Solution: Structured reporting templates

❌ **Integration complexity**
✅ Solution: Clear handoff protocols

❌ **Context loss between agents**
✅ Solution: Comprehensive CLAUDE.md files per workspace

## Quick Start Template

```bash
# 1. Setup workspaces
mkdir project-{main,fe,be,qa}-workspace

# 2. Configure PM Agent
cd project-main-workspace
echo "PM Agent: Coordinate FE, BE, QA agents for [feature]" > CLAUDE.md

# 3. Spawn agents as needed
# PM → task breakdown
# FE → UI implementation  
# BE → API development
# QA → testing strategy

# 4. Coordinate through PM Agent
# Regular status reports
# Integration handoffs  
# Quality gate reviews
```
